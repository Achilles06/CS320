    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
      
      Once checking the code is functional and appear error, testing can take place using whatever testing program and tools that are available. In this cas, the project code was developed through Java and Eclipse. The testing enviroment that was being used was Junit. To make sure the code is secure, coding security practices need to be implemented into the development process along with creating in program certificates to secure communication. 
      
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
      
      It is important to communicate what the user is looking for in the program. The skill to translate the user needs to the program is done well with practice, communication, and update consistently any changes the user would want to see. Having the user testing the program before putting it out for main stream use by the agile methodolgy. 
      
    How do I approach designing software?
    
    I approach a designing a program by first seeing what the owners and users want to see in the program and how they want to see. Once I gather the main requirments for the first deployment by the owners. Next talking to users and knowing their requests. Making sure all the requests can be properly displayed in a UML. Going over the UML class, activity, and sequence diagrams etc. with the development team and then putting it in the program. Testing the program with the users and development testing as well for functionlity and security.
